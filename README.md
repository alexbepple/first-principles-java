# What is this?

This is an example for teaching principles for good unit tests.

The branches of this repo contain different stages of the example. 

* [_master_](https://github.com/alexbepple/first-principles-java/tree/master) contains examples of bad tests. They are not unit tests.
* [_beispielloesungen_](https://github.com/alexbepple/first-principles-java/tree/beispielloesungen) contains suggestions for fixing some of those. For some of the examples, I have included alternative solutions.
